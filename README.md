**About This Site**
This is my Code Louisville Capstone Project for Course 2 of the Web Development pathway demonstrating the skills I have acquired in Front End Development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a responsive website giving users information on Thrasher Magazine's Skater of the year contest.

On the home page, users can view the top eight contenders for this year's contest. Each contender has clickable name and image links taking you to a profile page which gives information on that particular skater along with images and video players containing the video parts they produced for the year. Users can visit the about page to find information on the history of the contest. There is also a contact page for users to send a message on their thoughts of who they think should win the contest.

**Features I chose to implement:**
    
**1. Calculate and display data based on an external factor**
-This was achieved by creating a live countdown to the day the contest is announced located on the home page. 
-The code for this can be found in the countdown.js file. 

**2. Visualize data in a user friendly way**
-Implemented this feature on the about page by creating two charts with information about previous winners of the contest.
-The code for this feature can be found in the charts.js file.

**3. Analyze text and display useful information about it**
-On the contact page of the site, there is a contact form that requires users to enter at least one character for their name, a valid email address, at least one character for a message, and the text area for the message has a live character counter. Once the user sends the message, the site will send back a thank you message that includes the user's name.
-The code for this can be found in the contact.js file.

**4. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app**
-On each of the profile pages for the contenders I have displayed video players of each contender's video parts they put out over the year using the youtube API.
-The code for this can be found in the braden.js, ishod.js, jake.js, kader.js, louie.js, tFunk.js, tj.js, and wade.js files.
