<space><space><space><space>This is my Code Louisville Capstone Project for Course 2 of the Web Development pathway demonstrating the skills I have acquired in Front End Development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a website giving users information on Thrasher Magazine's Skater of the year contest.

<space><space><space><space>On the home page, users can view the top eight contenders for this year's contest. Each contender has clickable name and image links taking you to a profile page which gives information on that particular skater along with images and video players containing the video parts they produced for the year. Users can visit the about page to find information on the history of the contest. There is also a contact page for users to send a message on their thoughts of who they think should win the contest.

**Features I chose to implement:**
    **1. Calculate and display data based on an external factor**
    - This was achieved by creating a live countdow until the day the contest is announced on the home page of the site. 
    -The code for this can be found in the countdown.js file.
